# Name & Age (Descending Recursion)

This project demonstrates recursion in C++ using a simple program that prints your name along with your age in descending order — from your entered age down to 0

# Description
-This repository contains a concise C++ program designed to illustrate the concept of descending recursion. The program takes a user’s name and age as input and then uses a recursive function to process or display this information in a descending manner, typically by decrementing the age or a counter until a base case is met. It serves as an educational example for understanding recursive function calls and their execution flow in C++
-It continues until the base condition age < 0 is reached, at which point the recursion stops..
